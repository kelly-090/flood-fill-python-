- Making an initial maze


Location

you guys are using chessi model.
reference to choice motor, sensor in UCLA

<noun>
- wall
- empty ==> is_valid
- current location : class location


<verb>
- create_empty_maze

[#Calculate distance]
- Update distance
- isConsistent ( does it have to change direction or not ? )

[#Make a move]
- Make a move
 => (directions mean) right, left, straight (fields)
- Take a new route ( it just stuck ; does it have to turn around? )
